# Histogram of Enhanced Image

Image enhancement is commonly used to improve the visual quality of an image. The quality of the images may be degraded for several reasons like the lack of operator expertise and quality of image capturing device. Generally, images are captured in bright, dark, or any uncontrolled environments. And if an image is captured in too bright or too dark environment , then enhancement is necessary for creating better looking image. Furthermore, events such as scanning or transmitting an image from one place to another may cause distortion to that image. Differences in brightness of different parts of an image due to shadow or non-uniform illumination also demand enhancement. For example, we may take an image where the face looks dark as compared to the background. However, in spite of the availability of many enhancement algorithms, there have been very little work focusing specifically on dark image (image mean, Î¼<0.5 , where the darkness is due to low illumination, not for dark-colored objects) enhancement, and these methods might also result in over-enhancement and/or unnatural effects.
